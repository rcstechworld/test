	<h1>Dummy static website</h1>

	<p>lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllellgggggggggggggggggggg, Nginx, Litespeed, Varnish, Squid or any file-serving application and don't have time to create a website everytime</p>

	<p>There is three pages with images (cats, apparently most common pictures on internet except for some you could not view at work, landscapes and video games). Two of them are png, the rest are jpg (I did not bother with gif since it doesn't seem used anymore).</p>

	<p>There are also the common files in a website, such as robots.txt, favicon.ico, etc</p>
	<p> Welcome Here !</p>
	<p>1. Listen to compliments and absorb them. If you have a tendency to dismiss or brush off compliments, stop! While it’s true that some people might manipulate you through compliments, many more might be noticing one of your VITAL signs—something you yourself may have overlooked. In 11th grade, my English teacher wrote at the top of one of my papers: “Do you like to write? There’s much in this essay that says that you do.” Although I took another career path, I never forgot this comment, and here I am writing after all.</p>

	
        <p>I created this dummy website from a template (yes, I was lazy even for that :) ) that you can get there : https://html5boilerplate.com/</p>
